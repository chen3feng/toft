// The AutoResetEvent class represents a local waitable event that resets
// automatically when signaled, after releasing a single waiting thread.
//
// AutoResetEvent allows threads to communicate with each other by signaling.
// Typically, you use this class when threads need exclusive access to a resource.
//
// Important
// There is no guarantee that every call to the Set method will release a thread.
// If two calls are too close together, so that the second call occurs before a
// thread has been released, only one thread is released. It is as if the second
// call did not happen. Also, if Set is called when there are no threads waiting
// and the AutoResetEvent is already signaled, the call has no effect.
//
// If you want to release a thread after each call, Semaphore is a good choice.
